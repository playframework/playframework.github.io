WS provides an abstraction called handlers to allow cross cutting concerns to be implemented across all calls. Handlers are able to inspect and modify the incoming and outgoing messages, including SOAP data objects and request/response headers. They’re also able to block requests from being made entirely. Use cases for handlers include logging, security, monitoring, and many other application specific concerns. For examples of how to implement security using handlers, see Security. A handler can be implemented by extending a sub type of javax.xml.ws.handler.Handler. Which subtype you implement depends on your use case, for more details about the types of handlers, see here. We’ll implement a simple logging handler, to do this we extend javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPHandler. import javax.xml.namespace.QName; import javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage; import javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPHandler; import javax.xml.ws.handler.soap.SOAPMessageContext; import java.util.Set; public class LoggingHandler implements SOAPHandler { public Set getHeaders() { return null; } public boolean handleMessage(SOAPMessageContext context) { Boolean outbound = (Boolean) context.get(MessageContext.MESSAGE_OUTBOUND_PROPERTY); SOAPMessage message = context.getMessage(); try { if (outbound) { System.out.println(\"Sending message:\"); message.writeTo(System.out); } else { Integer responseCode = (Integer) context.get(MessageContext.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE); System.out.println(\"Received \" + responseCode + \"response:\"); message.writeTo(System.out); } System.out.println(); } catch (Exception e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } return true; } public boolean handleFault(SOAPMessageContext context) { return true; } public void close(MessageContext context) { } } The main method to implement here is the handleMessage method. It takes in the message context, and returns a boolean to say whether message processing should continue down the handler chain. By returning false, you can block the request. The same method is invoked for outgoing messages (that is, the request sent to the server) and incoming messages (that is, the response coming from the server). To know whether a message is incoming or outgoing, the outbound property needs to be checked. This is done using the following code: Boolean outbound = (Boolean) context.get(MessageContext.MESSAGE_OUTBOUND_PROPERTY); You can see that the SOAP message is also being loaded so that it can be logged, this is the XML representation of the method invocation or response. You can also see that the HTTP response code is being read from incoming messages, and being logged. To use the logging handler that we implemented, we can supply it to get method for our port from the service. For example, to use it with the HelloWorldService that we saw earlier in the documentation, simply pass the list of handlers to the getHelloWorld method, like so: HelloWorld client = helloWorldService.getHelloWorld(new LoggingHandler()); A handler can be implemented by extending a sub type of javax.xml.ws.handler.Handler.

It takes in the message context, and returns a boolean to say whether message processing should continue down the handler chain. By returning false, you can block the request. The same method is invoked for outgoing messages (that is, the request sent to the server) and incoming messages (that is, the response coming from the server).

How you access it depends on the service and port names in the WSDL. Consider the following service section from a WSDL: Assuming that the package name that the client was generated into is com.example, Play will generate a service class called com.example.HelloWorldService. This class is actually a Play plugin that allows you to configure the client, including configuring the address for each port to use. Note that there are some situations where sbt WSDL won’t use the service name from the WSDL, these are when the name of the service conflicts with another class that it generated, such as the name of the service endpoint interface. In that case, sbt WSDL will append _Service to the end of the service name, for example com.example.HelloWorldService_Service. Having located the service class, you can now get a port. In the above WSDL there is one port named HelloWorld, and, according to the HelloWorldSoapBinding (not shown above), this returns a service endpoint interface called HelloWorld. To access the endpoint, simply have it injected into your components or controllers, like so in Scala: class MyComponent @Inject() (helloWorldService: HelloWorldService) { val client: HelloWorld = helloWorldService.helloWorld } Or in Java: public class MyComponent { private final HelloWorldService helloWorldService; @Inject public MyComponent(HelloWorldService helloWorldService) { this.helloWorldService - helloWorldService; } public void someMethod() { HelloWorld client = helloWorldService.getHelloWorld(); // use the client somehow } } Once you’ve got a reference to the client, you can invoke methods on it. For example, let’s assume our client has operation called sayHello that takes a String parameter and returns a String parameter. To invoke this from a Play Scala action, you would do this: import play.api.libs.concurrent.Execution.Implicits._ def hello(name: String) = Action.async { val client: HelloWorld = helloWorldService.helloWorld client.sayHello(name).map { answer => Ok(answer) } } To invoke it from a Play Java action you would do this: import java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage; public CompletionStage hello(String name) { HelloWorld client = helloWorldService.getHelloWorld(); return client.sayHello(name).map(answer -> { return ok(answer); }); } The generated data objects will all be Java beans, with getter/setter style properties, and using Java collections. For convenience when working with the Java collections, you may import the Scala implicit conversions for Scala collections, like so: import scala.collection.JavaConverters._ Using this you can work with Java collections as if they were Scala collections, and pass Scala collections to setters and methods that accept Java collections. It’s also important to remember that many properties could be null. A pure Scala client that uses case classes, Scala collections and Option is a possible future enhancement for the Play SOAP library. Configuration for the client works hierarchically, each configuration item is first checked to see if it’s defined for the port, if not then for the service, and finally globally. The format for global configuration is play.soap.*. The format for configuration applying to a particular service is play.soap.services., where is the fully qualified service name, for example, com.example.HelloWorldService. The format for configuration applying to a particular port is play.soap.services..ports., where is the name of the port, for example HelloWorld. So for the client above, to set the debug log just for the port, you would set: play.soap.services.com.example.HelloWorldService.ports.HelloWorld.debugLog = true To set it for the whole service, you would set: play.soap.services.com.example.HelloWorldService.debugLog = true And to set it globally, you would set: play.soap.debugLog = true The address of a port can be set using the address property. For example, to set the address of every port for the HelloWorldService: play.soap.services.com.example.HelloWorldService.address = \"http://example.com/helloWorld\" The debug log will log the outbound and inbound messages, including HTTP headers, made by the client. An example of this is as follows: 16:52:17.953 [pool-1-thread-1] INFO o.a.c.s.H.HelloWorldPort.HelloWorld - Outbound Message --------------------------- ID: 1 Address: http://example.com/helloWorld Encoding: UTF-8 Http-Method: POST Content-Type: text/xml Headers: {Accept=[*/*], SOAPAction=[\"\"]} Payload: world -------------------------------------- 16:52:18.180 [default-workqueue-1] INFO o.a.c.s.H.HelloWorldPort.HelloWorld - Inbound Message ---------------------------- ID: 1 Response-Code: 200 Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8 Headers: {Content-Length=[204], content-type=[text/xml;charset=UTF-8], Server=[Jetty(8.1.15.v20140411)]} Payload: Hello world -------------------------------------- The debug log can be turned on using the debugLog property, for example, to turn it on globally: play.soap.debugLog = true In combination with the debugLog property, you may need to adjust the logging levels in your Play application. To see the debug log, you need to ensure that org.apache.cxf.services is configured to log at least INFO messages.

There are two ways to supply WSDLs to the plugin. One is to configure a URL or set of URLs to point the compiler at. This can be done by using the wsdlUrls setting: WsdlKeys.wsdlUrls in Compile += url(\"http://someservice.com/path?wsdl\") Notice that the setting must be in the compile scope - WSDL’s can also be compiled just for the Test scope too. The other is to place WSDLs in the conf/wsdls directory for a Play project, or in src/main/wsdl for an ordinary SBT project. You can also use both local files and urls. sbt WSDL can generate clients to either return scala.concurrent.Future for Scala projects, or java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage for Java projects. If your project is a Play project, the future API will automatically be selected based on whether you enabled the PlayJava or PlayScala plugin. If it’s an ordinary sbt project, it will default to scala.concurrent.Future. This can be configured to use the Java promise using the futureApi setting: WsdlKeys.futureApi := WsdlKeys.PlayJavaFutureApi By default, all WSDLs will be generated into a package structure that matches the namespace in the WSDL. For example, if you have a WSDL that defines a targetNamespace=\"http://example.com/\", the package that the client will be generated into will be com.example. The package can be configured in many ways. One way is to override it globally, that is, for all WSDLs and namespaces, this can be done using the packageName setting: WsdlKeys.packageName := Some(\"com.mycompany.example\") Additionally, individual namespaces can be configured using the packageMappings setting: WsdlKeys.packageMappings += (\"http://example.com/\" -> \"com.mycompany.example\") Both packageName and packageMappings can be used together, packageMappings will take precedence over packageName. The service name from the WSDL can be overridden if desired, using the serviceName setting: WsdlKeys.serviceName := Some(\"MyService\") sbt WSDL is built on top of the Apache CXF wsdl2java tool. Many of the options that it supports can also be used when you’re using sbt WSDL. To see a full list of options supported by Apache CXF, run sbt wsdlHelp. These options can then be configured in your build by adding them to the wsdlArgs setting. For example, if you the WSDL contains an operation called sayHello, and you want this to be generated using wrapper style (that is, all the arguments to the method are passed using a single object that wraps them), you could add the following configuration: WsdlKeys.wsdlToCodeArgs += \"-bareMethods=sayHello\" In some cases you may want to have completely different configurations for different WSDL files - or you may want to use the same WSDL file to generate two different clients. This can be done using the wsdlTasks task. By default, this task is built by combining all the settings used above, but if you override it, then the settings above will be ignored. Each wsdl generation task that is executed is defined by the following case class: case class WsdlTask( url: URL, futureApi: FutureApi = ScalaFutureApi, packageName: Option[String] = None, packageMappings: Map[String, String] = Map.empty, serviceName: Option[String] = None, args: Seq[String] = Nil ) Let’s say you have one WSDL on the filesystem in src/main/wsdl/foo.wsdl, and you want it generated into the com.example.foo package using the Scala future API, and another WSDL at http://example.com/bar?wsdl that you want generated into the com.example.bar package using the Java future API, then you could configure that like this: WsdlKeys.wsdlTasks in Compile := Seq( WsdlKeys.WsdlTask((sourceDirectory.value / \"wsdl\" / \"foo.wsdl\").toURI.toURL), packageName = Some(\"com.example.foo\") ), WsdlKeys.WsdlTask(url(\"http://example.com/bar?wsdl\"), futureApi = WsdlKeys.PlayJavaFutureApi, packageName = Some(\"com.example.bar\") ) )","title":"Using sbt WSDL","component":"play-soap","version":"1.x","name":"sbt-wsdl","url":"/play-soap/1.x/sbt-wsdl.html","titles":[{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":1},{"text":"Supplying WSDLs","hash":"_supplying_wsdls","id":2},{"text":"Configuring WSDL compilation","hash":"_configuring_wsdl_compilation","id":3},{"text":"Selecting the future API","hash":"_selecting_the_future_api","id":4},{"text":"Configuring the package name","hash":"_configuring_the_package_name","id":5},{"text":"Configuring the service name","hash":"_configuring_the_service_name","id":6},{"text":"Advanced configuration","hash":"_advanced_configuration","id":7},{"text":"Supplying additional arguments to wsdl2java","hash":"_supplying_additional_arguments_to_wsdl2java","id":8},{"text":"Using different configurations for different WSDL files","hash":"_using_different_configurations_for_different_wsdl_files","id":9}]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"Most security protocols can be implemented in Play SOAP using handlers.

Play SOAP methods all return promises, making them easy to compose with promises from other libraries, and allowing application code to be focussed on business logic, not on wiring asynchronous callbacks together. To implement the proxy, we have to implement our own version of JaxWsClientProxy. This is the CXF JDK proxy interceptor that implements JAX WS interfaces. It’s here that asynchronous requests are handled, and the logic here is hard coded - it implements the JAX WS requirements, if a method ends in Async and returns something that implements Future then dispatch an asynchronous call. Hence why we have to implement our own to make every method asynchronous regardless of name, and to allow scala Future and Java CompletionStage return types. This class has a lot of logic copied from JaxWsClientProxy, the actual part that has been customised is quite simple, it just creates a promise, and sends an asynchronous callback that redeems the promise. When the SOAP bindings are generated, JAXB bindings are generated from the return type. Since this type is a future, we need to tell CXF to use the type it contains. JAX WS provides a Holder type, this is used to allow methods return multiple values, something that is not possible otherwise in Java. It does this by having the first value returned as the return value of the method, and passing additional Holder objects as arguments to the method, whose values are set when the method returns. Although this wasn’t designed with returning futures in mind, the implementation of it in Apache CXF makes it quite simple to reuse this mechanism to extract the return type, hence this is what we’re doing. This allows us to completely reuse all the reflection code from Apache CXF that generates the bindings from the interface. In future, we may decide to implement our own reflection code for generating bindings, but for now using the Holder mechanism is good enough. A small amount of hacking is necessary to use it, due to some odd behaviour by the CXF JAX WS support - when the bindings are created, the JAX WS support automatically inserts its own configuration, and implements it in such a way that any configuration that we’ve added for holders gets overridden. We work around this by overriding a method that eventually injects this configuration but is invoked before the binding is actually done, and after invoking the super for the method, we inject our own configuration to override the default behaviour.","title":"Play SOAP","component":"play-soap","version":"2.x","name":"index","url":"/play-soap/2.x/index.html","titles":[{"text":"JAX WS support","hash":"_jax_ws_support","id":1},{"text":"Client proxy","hash":"_client_proxy","id":2},{"text":"Proxy interceptor","hash":"_proxy_interceptor","id":3},{"text":"Return type binding","hash":"_return_type_binding","id":4}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"JAX WS provides an abstraction called handlers to allow cross cutting concerns to be implemented across all calls.

An example of this is as follows: 16:52:17.953 [pool-1-thread-1] INFO o.a.c.s.H.HelloWorldPort.HelloWorld - Outbound Message --------------------------- ID: 1 Address: http://example.com/helloWorld Encoding: UTF-8 Http-Method: POST Content-Type: text/xml Headers: {Accept=[*/*], SOAPAction=[\"\"]} Payload: world -------------------------------------- 16:52:18.180 [default-workqueue-1] INFO o.a.c.s.H.HelloWorldPort.HelloWorld - Inbound Message ---------------------------- ID: 1 Response-Code: 200 Encoding: UTF-8 Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8 Headers: {Content-Length=[204], content-type=[text/xml;charset=UTF-8], Server=[Jetty(8.1.15.v20140411)]} Payload: Hello world -------------------------------------- The debug log can be turned on using the debugLog property, for example, to turn it on globally: play.soap.debugLog = true In combination with the debugLog property, you may need to adjust the logging levels in your Play application. To see the debug log, you need to ensure that org.apache.cxf.services is configured to log at least INFO messages. This can be further refined by supplying the service name, port and service endpoint interface name, for example, org.apache.cxf.services.HelloWorldService.","title":"Using the Play SOAP client","component":"play-soap","version":"2.x","name":"play-soap-client","url":"/play-soap/2.x/client/play-soap-client.html","titles":[{"text":"Accessing the client","hash":"_accessing_the_client","id":1},{"text":"Using the client","hash":"_using_the_client","id":2},{"text":"A note on using Scala","hash":"_a_note_on_using_scala","id":3},{"text":"Configuring the client","hash":"_configuring_the_client","id":4},{"text":"Changing the address","hash":"_changing_the_address","id":5},{"text":"Turning on the debug log","hash":"_turning_on_the_debug_log","id":6}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Most security protocols can be implemented in Play SOAP using handlers. For general documentation on handlers, see here. Let’s say you wanted to make authenticated requests on a web service that expected an authentication token in the request header. To implement this, you can get the request headers from the message context, and add the authentication token there. The HTTP request headers can be loaded by reading the javax.xml.ws.handler.MessageContext.HTTP_REQUEST_HEADERS property.

To use gRPC in Play Framework you must enable HTTP/2 Support. Generating classes from the gRPC service definition is done by adding the Pekko gRPC plugin to your sbt build along with the Play gRPC generators: // in project/plugins.sbt: addSbtPlugin(\"org.apache.pekko\" % \"pekko-grpc-sbt-plugin\" % \"1.0.2\") resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo(\"snapshots\") libraryDependencies += \"org.playframework\" %% \"play-grpc-generators\" % \"0.12.x\" Then you need to enable the Play server side code generator in build.sbt: Scala Java enablePlugins(PekkoGrpcPlugin) import play.grpc.gen.scaladsl.PlayScalaServerCodeGenerator pekkoGrpcExtraGenerators += PlayScalaServerCodeGenerator libraryDependencies += \"org.playframework\" %% \"play-grpc-runtime\" % \"0.12.x\" enablePlugins(PekkoGrpcPlugin) import play.grpc.gen.javadsl.PlayJavaServerCodeGenerator pekkoGrpcExtraGenerators += PlayJavaServerCodeGenerator libraryDependencies += \"org.playframework\" %% \"play-grpc-runtime\" % \"0.12.x\" The plugin will look for .proto service descriptors in app/protobuf and output an abstract class per service that you then implement, so for example for the following protobuf descriptor: syntax = \"proto3\"; option java_multiple_files = true; option java_package = \"example.myapp.helloworld.grpc\"; option java_outer_classname = \"HelloWorldProto\"; package helloworld; service GreeterService { rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } message HelloRequest { string name = 1; } message HelloReply { string message = 1; } You will get an abstract class named example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.helloworld.AbstractGreeterServiceRouter. example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.AbstractGreeterServiceRouter. Create a concrete subclass implementing this wherever you see fit in your project, let’s say controller.GreeterServiceImpl like so: Scala Java package controllers import javax.inject.Inject import javax.inject.Singleton import scala.concurrent.Future import example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.helloworld.AbstractGreeterServiceRouter import example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.helloworld.HelloReply import example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.helloworld.HelloRequest import org.apache.pekko.actor.ActorSystem /** User implementation, with support for dependency injection etc */ @Singleton class GreeterServiceImpl @Inject() (implicit actorSystem: ActorSystem) extends AbstractGreeterServiceRouter(actorSystem) { override def sayHello(in: HelloRequest): Future[HelloReply] = Future.successful(HelloReply(s\"Hello, ${in.name}!\")) } package controllers; import org.apache.pekko.actor.ActorSystem; import com.google.inject.Inject; import example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.AbstractGreeterServiceRouter; import example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.HelloReply; import example.myapp.helloworld.grpc.HelloRequest; import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture; import java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage; import javax.inject.Singleton; /** User implementation, with support for dependency injection etc */ @Singleton public class GreeterServiceImpl extends AbstractGreeterServiceRouter { @Inject public GreeterServiceImpl(ActorSystem actorSystem) { super(actorSystem); } @Override public CompletionStage sayHello(HelloRequest in) { String message = String.format(\"Hello, %s!\", in.getName()); HelloReply reply = HelloReply.newBuilder().setMessage(message).build(); return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(reply); } } And then add the router to your Play conf/routes file. Note that the router already knows its own path since it is based on the package name and service name of the service and therefore the path / is enough to get it to end up in the right place (in this example the path will be /helloworld.GreeterService). It cannot be added at an arbitrary path (if you try to do so an exception will be thrown when the router is started). -> / controllers.GreeterServiceImpl A gRPC client can now connect to the server and call the provided services.","title":"Serving gRPC from
